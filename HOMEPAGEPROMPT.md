## Initial prompt

I need a home page that will impress new users and convince them to create an account to try out chesslog.me. Use the frontend-design skill. Use as much of the following info as is helpful to achieve that goal. The app helps users improve at chess by keeping track of what really happens in their games - most importantly, the areas where they make mistakes - so they can focus their training on those areas. The reason this app is needed is that human perception is weak at these kinds of tasks; we tend to use confirmation bias to remember lessons we want to remember and forget lessons that don't conform to our preconceived ideas. Data collection like the kind offered by chesslog.me can correct for this. For each chess game the user has played, they can write freeform notes or add tags. The app can create graphs based on the data the user enters. Coaches can use the app to view their players' tags and notes, and comment on each game.

## Follow-up 1

This looks great. A couple of other points I'd like to get across. Other apps analyze your chess game data, and calculate things like "23% win rate with the Sicilian" or "endgames are your strength". chesslog.me is not trying to duplicate that functionality. What we have that other apps don't is data about what's happening inside your head. Other apps just have the game data. They don't know which mistakes are the easiest - for you, personally - to correct.

Also, don't use the word "annotate" - that implies move-by-move analysis, which other apps do well and we are not trying to duplicate. Instead, chesslog.me focuses the user on the biggest lessons from each game.

Another point (use as much or as little of this as is helpful to achieve our goal of getting the user to create an account): Chess books and courses are great, and there are a ton of them, but after you've read a bunch of them, there's little improvement to be had from reading more. The key to improvement at this point is **introspection**. Think about what you were thinking when you made a mistake, or how your own thinking can be improved. I think a lot of chess improvers know this, but aren't sure how to get introspective.

## Follow-up 2

In the how-it-works section, we need to include the fact that chesslog.me also works for OTB games (over-the-board, or in-person chess), in addition to online games on chess.com and lichess.

## Follow-up 3

On desktop "Your games tell a story" the word "story" is alone on its own line and it looks funny.

## Follow-up 4

In the "for coaches" section, the existing description sounds like it's describing Lichess studies (basic chess game annotating app). I think this section should focus on what's different about chesslog.me. This is all about the **takeaways**, and chess coaches are often pointing out to their students that they have the wrong takeaways from a game.
